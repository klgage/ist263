                    <h3>The Zodiac Killer</h3>
                    <p>Known by everything but their identity, the Zodiac Killer was notorious for sending 
                        cryptic letters to the press. This unidentified criminal remains a mystery today.</p>
                    <p>The Zodiac Killer is an unidentified serial killer who operated in northern California during 
                        the late 1960s and early 1970s. Known for their cryptic letters sent to the press, they claimed to 
                        have killed 37 people, though only five victims have been definitively linked to them. The 
                        killer's behavior and taunting messages to law enforcement kept the public and authorities 
                        on edge for years.</p>
                    <p>Despite extensive investigations and numerous suspects over the decades, the Zodiac's identity 
                        remains unknown. Their last confirmed murder occurred in 1969, and they eventually stopped 
                        communicating with the media. The case remains one of the most infamous unsolved mysteries 
                        in criminal history, with new theories and advancements in DNA technology sparking interest 
                        in uncovering their true identity.</p>
